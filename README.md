# CatImage
A simple Cat Image Light ON/OFF clone built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. This fun project switches a cat image between light and dark modes when toggled, demonstrating DOM manipulation, Bootstrap styling, and event handling in JavaScript. A great beginner-friendly UI project!
